<p>Office shoes are footwear designed to be worn in a professional environment, blending style with comfort and practicality to suit a particular workplace's dress code.

<p>Safety shoes are a type of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) designed to protect feet from workplace hazards like falling objects, sharp objects, slips, and electrical issues. They feature components such as toe caps, puncture-resistant soles, and energy-absorbing heels to prevent injuries from impact, compression, and penetration. Safety shoes are categorized by standards, such as the EN ISO 20345 standard, which specifies different protection levels (like S1, S3, S5) based on features like water resistance, anti-static properties, and sole protection.
