<p>A drink, or beverage, is a liquid intended for human consumption to quench thirst, provide nourishment, or for enjoyment. Drinks are broadly categorized as either alcoholic or non-alcoholic, with examples ranging from plain water and juices to coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages like beer and spirits. They play significant roles in human culture, from simple refreshment to ceremonial offerings, and can be consumed hot or cold. 
</p>

<h1 id="h2">Heading 2</h1>
<p>Juice is the natural liquid extracted from fruits or vegetables, consumed as a beverage or used in food, but the term also has several informal and slang meanings, including the liquid from cooked meat, energy or power, gasoline, or even illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Fruit juice provides vitamins and minerals but lacks the fiber found in whole fruit, and its quality depends on the fruit's maturity, species, and preparation methods.  
</p>


<h1 id="h3">Heading 3</h1>
<p>"Shake" is a versatile word describing quick, repeated movements in opposite directions, which can apply to objects (like shaking a bottle), people (like a handshake or trembling with fear), or even concepts (like shaking someone's beliefs). It can be a verb, meaning to move something rapidly back and forth or up and down, or an intransitive verb, describing the action of an object or person that is itself making those movements. It also has noun forms, referring to the action itself or a drink called a milkshake. 
</p>

<h1 id="h4">Heading 4</h1>
<p>Alcohol is a psychoactive drug, chemically ethanol, that acts as a central nervous system depressant, slowing down brain activity and affecting mood, behavior, and coordination. It is produced by fermenting sugars from grains, fruits, or vegetables and is found in alcoholic drinks like beer, wine, and liquor. While low doses can cause relaxation, higher amounts lead to intoxication, impairing cognitive functions, coordination, and judgment, and can have serious long-term health consequences. 
</p>


<h1 id="h5">Heading 5</h1>
<p>Healthy drinks are beverages that provide hydration and nutrients without excessive sugar or calories, with water being the healthiest choice. Other beneficial options include herbal and green teas, vegetable juices, and coconut water, which offer various vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Healthy alternatives to sugary drinks also include coffee, milk, and unsweetened sparkling water.
