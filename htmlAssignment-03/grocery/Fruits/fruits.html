<p>A fruit is the mature ovary of a flowering plant, containing its seeds, and develops from the plant's flower. Botanically, fruits are any seed-bearing structures of angiosperms, including items we commonly consider vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and beans. They primarily function in seed protection and dispersal, often through symbiotic relationships with animals and humans who consume the nutritious fruit and spread the seeds. Fruits are a vital part of our diet, providing essential vitamins, fiber, and other nutrients, and can be consumed in various forms, including fresh, frozen, dried, or juiced.

    <h1 id="h2">Heading 2</h1>
    <p>An apple can refer to the fruit, a round pome fruit from the apple tree (genus Malus), which is a widely popular and nutritious source of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. It can also refer to Apple Inc., a major multinational technology company famous for its innovative products like the iPhone and Mac computers, founded in 1976 and now known for its hardware, software, and online services.

    <h1 id="h3">Heading 3</h1>
    <p>"Kiwi" can refer to the flightless New Zealand bird or the edible fruit from the Actinidia vine, formerly called Chinese gooseberry. The New Zealand kiwi bird is a national symbol, while the fruit was renamed after the bird for marketing purposes. The fruit is a fuzzy-skinned, green-fleshed berry with tiny, edible black seeds and is a good source of vitamin C.

    <h1 id="h4">Heading 4</h1>
     <p>A watermelon is a large, juicy fruit of a creeping vine in the gourd family, known for its high water content and sweet, often red, flesh with a hard green rind. Botanically a pepo (a type of berry) but often considered a fruit in a culinary sense, it is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash. Watermelons are a source of vitamins A and C, lycopene, and other antioxidants, offering hydration and various health benefits.  
</p>

    <h1 id="h5">Heading 5</h1>
     <p>Seasonal fruits are those that are naturally harvested during a specific time of year, offering richer flavor and higher nutritional value, being more affordable due to natural cycles, and supporting local economies and the environment by reducing transport distances and chemical use. For example, summer fruits like watermelons and mangoes provide hydration and vitamins suitable for the warm season, while winter fruits like apples and citrus are abundant and offer specific nutrients for cooler weather.
